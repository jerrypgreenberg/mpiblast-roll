<para>
blast  is a freely available, open-source, parallel implementation of [NCBI BLAST] (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). By efficiently utilizing distributed computational resources through database fragmentation, query segmentation, intelligent scheduling, and parallel I/O, mpiBLAST improves NCBI BLAST performance by several orders of magnitude while scaling to hundreds of processors
